function d = estimation_gap(vertices_A, vertices_B)
%   Return the Hausdorff distance between Set A (the estimation) and Set B (the actual range).
%   Sets A and B are with V-representation (i.e., described by vertices).
%   Note that vertices_A is N_A-by-n, where N_A is the number of vertices and n isthe dimension of each vertex, so as vertices_B.
